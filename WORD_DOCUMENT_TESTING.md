# Word Document Parsing - Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Server will run on http://localhost:3001
# Frontend will run on http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. Test Files

Create test Word documents with the following content:

**Test Document 1: Simple Text (test1.docx)**
```
Feature: User Login

Users must be able to log in with email and password.
Given a user visits the login page
When they enter valid credentials
Then they should be logged in
```

**Test Document 2: Multiple Sections (test2.docx)**
```
Requirement 1: Database Setup

The system must connect to PostgreSQL.
Must support connection pooling
Should handle connection failures gracefully

Requirement 2: API Security

Endpoints must require authentication.
Should use JWT tokens
Must validate all inputs
```

**Test Document 3: Formatted Content (test3.docx)**
```
Project: Analytics Dashboard

Features:
• User authentication
• Real-time data visualization
• Export to CSV

Acceptance Criteria:
Given a user is logged in
When they access the dashboard
Then they should see real-time data
And all charts should load within 2 seconds
```

### 3. Manual Testing Scenarios

### 4. API Testing

#### Test Endpoint with cURL

```bash
# Test with Word document
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/upload/document \
  -F "file=@test1.docx"

# Expected response:
{
  "tickets": [
    {
      "id": "MVM-1001",
      "summary": "Feature: User Login",
      "description": "Users must be able to log in...",
      "priority": "Medium",
      "assignee": "Unassigned",
      "epic": "No Epic",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Given a user visits the login page",
        "When they enter valid credentials",
        "Then they should be logged in"
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-10-26T...",
      "_grounding": {
        "validated": true,
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "issues": [],
        "warnings": []
      }
    }
  ],
  "source": "document",
  "fileType": "word"
}
```

#### Test with Postman

1. Create new POST request
2. URL: `http://localhost:3001/api/upload/document`
3. Body tab: form-data
4. Key: `file` (type: File)
5. Value: Select test document
6. Send
7. View response

### 5. Console Testing

#### Test DocumentParser Service

```javascript
// In browser console or Node.js
import DocumentParser from './src/services/documentParser.js'

const parser = new DocumentParser()

// Test plain text extraction
const text = await parser.parseWordDocument(fileBuffer)
console.log('Extracted text:', text)

// Test structured extraction
const structured = await parser.extractStructuredContent(fileBuffer)
console.log('Headings:', structured.headings)
console.log('Lists:', structured.lists)
console.log('Tables:', structured.tables)

// Test ticket conversion
const tickets = parser.convertToTickets(text, {
  priority: 'High',
  assignee: 'Test User',
  epic: 'Test Epic'
})
console.log('Generated tickets:', tickets)
```

### 6. Validation Checklist

- [ ] Word documents (.docx) are accepted
- [ ] Excel files (.xlsx) still work (backward compatible)
- [ ] Invalid file types are rejected
- [ ] Text is properly extracted
- [ ] Headings are identified
- [ ] Lists are parsed
- [ ] Tables are recognized
- [ ] Acceptance criteria detected
- [ ] Grounding validation applied
- [ ] Confidence scores calculated
- [ ] Monitoring service tracks uploads
- [ ] Tickets can be sent to Jira
- [ ] File type indicator shows correctly
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works for both types
- [ ] Error messages are displayed

### 7. Performance Testing

#### Test Large Documents

```bash
# Create a large test document (10MB) and upload
# Monitor:
# - Processing time (should be < 5 seconds)
# - Memory usage (should not exceed 200MB)
# - Server response time
```

#### Test High Volume

```bash
# Rapid sequential uploads
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/upload/document \
    -F "file=@test.docx" &
done
wait

# Monitor for:
# - No crashes
# - Consistent response times
# - No memory leaks
```

### 8. Browser DevTools Testing

#### Console
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Verify API calls to `/api/upload/document`
- Monitor console logs from DocumentParser

#### Network Tab
- Verify POST request to `/api/upload/document`
- Check request payload (multipart form-data)
- Verify response contains tickets
- Monitor response time

#### Performance Tab
- Record while uploading and processing
- Look for frame drops or slowdowns
- Verify smooth UI transitions

### 9. Edge Cases

#### Test Case 1: Empty Document
```
Create a blank .docx file
Expected: Single "Untitled" ticket
```

#### Test Case 2: Very Long Document
```
Create document with 100+ paragraphs
Expected: Multiple tickets split by sections
```

#### Test Case 3: Unicode Characters
```
Create document with international characters (Hungarian, Chinese, etc.)
Expected: Characters preserved in tickets
```

#### Test Case 4: Complex Formatting
```
Create document with:
- Bold, italic, underline text
- Multiple font sizes
- Color-coded text
- Bullet lists with sub-items
- Tables with merged cells

Expected: Plain text extraction works, structure preserved
```

#### Test Case 5: Corrupted File
```
Upload a corrupted .docx file
Expected: Error message "Failed to parse Word document"
```

### 10. Integration Testing

     "fileSize": 12345,
     "fileName": "test.docx",
     "ticketsGenerated": 3,
     "averageConfidence": 0.85,
     "fileType": "word"
