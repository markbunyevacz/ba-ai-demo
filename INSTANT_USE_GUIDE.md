## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### No stakeholders extracted?
→ Check that ticket text contains explicit names or roles  
→ System looks for patterns like "John Smith", "assigned to:", etc.  
→ Generic names (User, Team, System) are filtered out  

### Validation warnings?
→ Yellow warnings are informational (review if needed)  
→ Red errors indicate critical issues (must fix)  
→ Check assignee format and team authorization  

### Low confidence scores?
→ Single mentions = lower confidence  
→ Multiple mentions = higher confidence  
→ Explicit roles (Product Owner, Manager) boost confidence  

### Can't see communication plans?
→ Click stakeholder row to expand details  
→ Plans are in expandable section  
→ Cadence and channels shown in detail view
